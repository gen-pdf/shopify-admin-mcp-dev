# Enum: `ProductStatus`

The possible product statuses.

## Values

- `ACTIVE` — The product is ready to sell and can be published to sales channels and apps. Products with an active status aren't automatically published to sales channels, such as the online store, or apps. By default, existing products are set to active.
- `ARCHIVED` — The product is no longer being sold and isn't available to customers on sales channels and apps.
- `DRAFT` — The product isn't ready to sell and is unavailable to customers on sales channels and apps. By default, duplicated and unarchived products are set to draft.
- `UNLISTED` — The product is active but you need a direct link to view it. The product doesn't show up in search, collections, or product recommendations. It will be returned in Storefront API and Liquid only when referenced individually by handle, id, or metafield reference.This status is only visible from 2025-10 and up, is translated to active in older versions and can't be changed from unlisted in older versions.
