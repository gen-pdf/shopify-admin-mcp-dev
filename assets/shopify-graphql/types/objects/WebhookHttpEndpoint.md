# Object: `WebhookHttpEndpoint`

An HTTPS endpoint that receives webhook events as POST requests, letting your app respond to Shopify events in real-time. This is the most common webhook endpoint type, allowing apps to process Shopify events through standard HTTP callbacks.

For example, when setting up order notifications, your app would provide an HTTPS URL like `https://yourapp.com/webhooks/orders/create` to receive order creation events as JSON payloads.

HTTP endpoints offer straightforward webhook integration with immediate event delivery, making them suitable for apps that need real-time notifications without complex infrastructure requirements.
