# Object: `Attribute`

A custom property. Attributes are used to store additional information about a Shopify resource, such as
products, customers, or orders. Attributes are stored as key-value pairs.

For example, a list of attributes might include whether a customer is a first-time buyer (`"customer_first_order": "true"`),
whether an order is gift-wrapped (`"gift_wrapped": "true"`), a preferred delivery date
(`"preferred_delivery_date": "2025-10-01"`), the discount applied (`"loyalty_discount_applied": "10%"`), and any
notes provided by the customer (`"customer_notes": "Please leave at the front door"`).

## Fields

- `key`: `String!` — The key or name of the attribute. For example, `"customer_first_order"`.
- `value`: `String` — The value of the attribute. For example, `"true"`.
