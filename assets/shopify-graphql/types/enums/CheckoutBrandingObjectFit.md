# Enum: `CheckoutBrandingObjectFit`

Possible values for object fit.

## Values

- `CONTAIN` — The Contain value for fit. The image is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the containing box. The entire image is made to fill the box, while preserving its aspect ratio, so the image will be "letterboxed" if its aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the box. This is the default value.
- `COVER` — The Cover value for fit. The image is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the entire containing box. If the image’s aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of the containing box, then the object will be clipped to fit.
