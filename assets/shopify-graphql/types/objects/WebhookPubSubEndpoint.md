# Object: `WebhookPubSubEndpoint`

Individual Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics that receive webhook events for reliable, asynchronous processing. This endpoint type lets your app tap into Google Cloud's messaging infrastructure to handle events at scale.

For example, when inventory levels change, Shopify can publish these events to your Pub/Sub topic `projects/your-project/topics/inventory-updates`, allowing your Google Cloud functions or services to process inventory changes at their own pace.

Pub/Sub endpoints provide reliable message delivery to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, making them excellent for apps that need to handle variable webhook volumes or integrate with Google Cloud Platform services.
